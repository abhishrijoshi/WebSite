<h2>WhatsApp is superior then signal and telegram and I am tired of pretending it's not </h2>
<p>
WHATSAPP BETA IS SUPERIOR, I am on beta and the WhatsApp client runs natively on browser theirs now NO need for phone so the most of the privacy concerns regarding the WhatsApp are just thrown out of the window

Let me tell you why

Signal code base is utter bullshit

It's just so stupid

MAJOR mess up by little mistake that every dev knows NOT to do 
</p>

<br>
<ol>
<li><a href ="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10247" > Sent image to wrong chats </a></li>
<li><a href =" https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/kyoeaq/signal_most_probably_ddosed_itself/" > ddosed themself </a></li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
People be like well you can't trust Facebook it's proprietary and mark bad

The thing is god knows what runs on signal server they release the code base sure ,but they release it late
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fact -WhatsApp chats are encrypted they can't see the chats and if run on browser very less meta data leak 
</p>
<p>
Fact - signal can also break encryption just like WhatsApp
</p>
<p>
Fact - Telegram chats are not encrypted only secret ones are that too with thier own protocol
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let's come to telegram now because mistakes like sending photos to wrong chats just can not be taken lightly
Telegram Chats are not encrypted whereas majority believe they are only secret chats are that to with their own protocol that THEY believe is good ( it sucks )

Features most features don't work when encrypted . 

voice calls are not encrypted video calls are you can call only 1 person

Groups are not encrypted

You can talk just to one person when encrypted

This is backwards in tech tbh then WhatsApp and their new beta is just soo good it works on browser and connect to 4 device and everything is encrypted and it sync just perfectly and doesn't have these things to worry about

And not to mention telegram can also do shady things to break encryption on server side

And they say it works on money from pavel they say he pays from he's own pocket 
</p>
<p>Anyways I am not saying to use WhatsApp I am just comparing it to product normies are comparing it to

I use matrix and I recommend using matrix with self hosted server

You can also use Xmpp protocol it's also really good </p>
