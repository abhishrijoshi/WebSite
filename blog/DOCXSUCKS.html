<p>DOCX SHALL NOT PREVAIL </p>
<p>Docx another peice of garbage by microsoft,its so rediculous it makes me wonder why? someone somewhere woke up and decided hey why not make a new filefomat and make it propritery and to my surprice people are using it because its by microsoft awesome example of poeple not knowing what they are doing whats wrong with the txt heck use pdf even though i dont like it but it atleast makes sense.
</p>
<p>
So now i have to download a viewer to view a god damm file that can be a txt,total ignorance of people using this format for rest of us ,i have to compile libre office or some other software on my lovely gentoo to view a god dam file do you know how much time it took me ? it was too much and viola guys one more peice of software now i have to check the vuln and keep things updated </p>
<p>These inconvince when i know about libreoffice if i didint i had to search for non microsoft software that is not garbage(no offense ) what is this we live in peak of human intellegance we shouldnt have to bother about incompatibility of a fricking file we shouldnt have to spend hours to open a file </p>
<P>As an fuck you to poeple i can send a file in a format that i made that is propritory that only my software or website can view that privides no real advantage and i charge money to view ,but i am not going to do it because i am not microsft or ms dev(no offense you are probably foreced to make) </p>
